/*
  Fade

  This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite()
  function.

  The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're
  using, be sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins
  are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

  This example code is in the public domain.

int led = 9;         // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;  // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;  // how many points to fade the LED by

// Fade speeds (delay in ms for each speed)
int fadeSpeeds[] = {30, 10, 60, 10}; // speed 1, 2, 3, 4
int fadesPerSpeed[] = {4, 3, 1, 2}; // number of fades per speed
int currentSpeed = 0;
int fadeCount = 0;
int numSpeeds = sizeof(fadeSpeeds) / sizeof(fadeSpeeds[0]);

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(led, brightness);
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
    fadeCount++;

    // After enough fades at current speed, switch to next speed
    if (fadeCount >= fadesPerSpeed[currentSpeed]) {
      fadeCount = 0;
      currentSpeed = (currentSpeed + 1) % numSpeeds;
    }
  }

  // Wait for the current speed's delay
  delay(fadeSpeeds[currentSpeed]);

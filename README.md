# 🎨 Arduino-Enhanced Diorama Collection

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of interactive diorama projects brought to life through Arduino microcontrollers. Each project combines traditional model-making with modern electronics to create engaging, educational, and visually stunning displays.

## 🌟 About This Collection

These dioramas go beyond static displays by incorporating:
- **Programmable lighting effects** - Dynamic LED patterns that bring scenes to life
- **Interactive controls** - Push-button interfaces for visitor engagement
- **Audio integration** - Educational commentary and ambient sounds
- **Realistic behaviors** - Scientifically accurate simulations of natural phenomena

Perfect for museums, educational institutions, home displays, or anyone interested in combining art, electronics, and education.
